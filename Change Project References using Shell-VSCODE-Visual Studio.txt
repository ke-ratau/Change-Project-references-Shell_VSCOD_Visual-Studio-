I want to change all the references for 'MyLaunchApp1' on my asp.net app to 'MyMegaApp1' accros my entire project. the name of the application is MyLaunchApp1, and all models, controllers, razors views, startup.cs, program.cs and appsettings.json reference this name MyLaunchApp1, and I want now the app to be named MyMegaApp1.can this be done using a single command?
	ANSWER:

Renaming all instances of "MyLaunchApp1" to "MyMegaApp1" in an ASP.NET project can be done efficiently using a single command with the `sed` utility if you're on a Unix-based system (Linux or macOS). If you are on Windows, you can use PowerShell or tools like `find` and `replace`.

Here's how to do it on different platforms:

### On Unix-based Systems (Linux/macOS):

You can use the `sed` command in the terminal to replace all instances of "MyLaunchApp1" with "MyMegaApp1" recursively in all files within your project directory.

Open a terminal and navigate to the root of your project directory, then run the following command:

```sh
find . -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/MyLaunchApp1/MyMegaApp1/g' {} +
```

### On Windows:

If you're on Windows, you can use PowerShell to achieve the same result. Open PowerShell and navigate to the root of your project directory, then run the following command:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | ForEach-Object {
    (Get-Content $_.FullName) -replace 'MyLaunchApp1', 'MyMegaApp1' | Set-Content $_.FullName
}
```

### Using Visual Studio:

If you prefer to use an IDE like Visual Studio, you can also do a global search and replace:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio.
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `H` to open the "Replace in Files" dialog.
3. In the "Find what:" field, enter `MyLaunchApp1`.
4. In the "Replace with:" field, enter `MyMegaApp1`.
5. Ensure the scope is set to "Entire Solution" or the appropriate scope for your project.
6. Click "Replace All".

### Using a Text Editor:

If you use a text editor like Visual Studio Code, you can perform a global search and replace:

1. Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `H` to open the "Search" pane.
3. Enter `MyLaunchApp1` in the "Search" field.
4. Enter `MyMegaApp1` in the "Replace" field.
5. Click on the "Replace All" button.

Choose the method that you are most comfortable with and that suits your operating system. These commands and steps should comprehensively rename all instances of "MyLaunchApp1" to "MyMegaApp1" across your entire project.
